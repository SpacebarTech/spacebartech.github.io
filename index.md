# JETS Wiki

Use the navigation on the left to explore available wiki entries.

## Get Started

Start by creating a new page in one of the categories
listed in `_config.yml` under the `page_categories`
sequence. It will appear in the side navigation once Jekyll
recompiles. Or use the supplied script to make creating
pages a bit easier.

```bash
# i.e. creating a new page called "Machine Learning
# in the engineering/ directory.

ruby bin/jekyll-page "Machine Learning" engineering
```

### Side note

At JETS, we understand that everyone has their own style of
how they like to write code (especially üÖ±Ô∏èulian). While
you may favor one thing over another, it's best to have a
consistent organization-wide styleguide that everyone can
agree on. And when you get home, feel free to return to
your favorite way of writing code. Always be constructive
when suggesting a change and always keep an open mind.
