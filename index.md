# JETS Wiki

Use the navigation on the left to explore available wiki entries.

## Get Started

Start by creating a new page in one of the categories
listed in `_config.yml` under the `page_categories`
sequence. It will appear in the side navigation once Jekyll
recompiles. Or use the supplied script to make creating
pages a bit easier.

```bash
# i.e. creating a new page called "Machine Learning
# in the engineering/ directory.

ruby bin/jekyll-page "Machine Learning" engineering
```
